        <h1>Real-Time String Matching</h1>
        <h3>A Deterministic Finite-State Matcher</h3>
        <h2>Real-Time Computing</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Here we define real-time method to do constant amount of work per
          step. In exact string matching, that would mean we do a constant
          amount of work for every new symbol. We could read in new symbols one
          at a time and spend constant time on exact string matching. Clearly
          a real-time method is also a linear time method, but linear time
          methods aren't quite under the same constraints. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          KMP is a linear time algorithm, but does not qualify as a real-time
          one. By using <em>sp'</em> values we are able to shift over
          unnecessary comparisons after a mismatch, guarantee that the
          prefix of pattern P from the mismatch will match text T, and
          guarantee a different letter in the pattern is used in the next
          comparison. However, we cannot guarantee that the next comparison
          will be a match.  Therefore some index k in T might be compared 
          multiple times, in fact up to |P| times with different letters in P.
          We can see here that despite KMP being bounded by 2m comparisons (where m is the size of T), it is not guaranteed to do constant time
          for every letter.
        </p>
        <h2>Extending Knuth-Morris-Pratt</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Similar to regular KMP, preprocessing will be used for the real-time
          extension of KMP. The preprocessing is quite similar to regular KMP
          preprocessing. Instead of <em>sp'<sub>i</sub></em> values, we will
          extend these to <em>sp'<sub>(i, x)</sub></em> values where 
          <em>x</em> is a letter in the alphabet with the same definition as
          <em>sp'<sub>i</sub></em> except the second condition is that
          P<sub><em>sp'<sub>i</sub></em></sub> == <em>x</em>. These new
          <em>sp'<sub>(i, x)</sub></em> values can still be computed in linear
          time and will enable us to do extend KMP into a real-time method.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          In the regular KMP algorithm, if a character of T is involved in a
          match, it is never examined a second time. The problem lies when
          a mismatch occurs. While running this algorithm, let's say a
          mismatch occurs at character T<sub>k</sub> == x and
          P<sub>i+1</sub>. P will be shifted <em>i - sp'<sub>(i, x)</sub></em>
          places. Like regular KMP, the shift guarantees that the prefix
          P[1..sp'<sub>(i, x)</sub>] matches the current substring in T. With
          the real-time method, we can also guarantee that the next character
          T<sub>k</sub>, and P<sub><em>sp'<sub>(i,x)</sub>+1</em></sub>
          match so this comparison can be skipped. The next comparison will
          be between P<sub><em>sp'<sub>(i,x)</sub>+2</em></sub> and
          T<sub>k+1</sub>.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          With this new method, we can claim it is a real-time method because
          it never reexamines a position in T regardless if it was involved in
          a mathc or mismatch. After preprocessing we only visit each character
          in T once. It can read in the text one character at a time and spend
          constant time for each position. 
        </p>
        <h2>Real-Time KMP</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Preprocessing and running real-time KMP is very similar to regular
          KMP. We use Z-values to determine <em>sp'<sub>(i, x)</sub></em>
          values as before and run the algorithm in the same way as before.
          One drawback from the real-time KMP method that isn't found in Z
          or KMP, is that the time and space complexities are dependent on
          alphabet size. Z and KMP are both alphabet-independent linear time
          methods.
