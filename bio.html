<h1>Larry Zhang Biography</h1>

<p>
Hi, my name is Larry Zhang from Long Island, New York.  I am currently a senior finishing up a biochemistry major, and computer science minor at Tufts University.  I currently work as a research technician at Tufts Medical.  In my nearly two years there, we have finished running two studies, and are planning on starting a third.  I am also a member of Theta Chi Fraternity at Tufts, and am very passionate about brotherhood and lending an assisting hand in brotherhood needs and philanthrophy events.
