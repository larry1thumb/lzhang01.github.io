        <h1>The Most Confounding Player in the NBA</h1>
        <p class="text">
        Marcus Smart is a point guard in the NBA playing for the Boston Celtics.  He was drafted 6th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft and quickly became one of the most divisive players on the Celtics roster. In a league that is becoming more and more dominated by 3 point shooting and analytics, many question if Smart has a future on this team.</p>
        <p> Though originally considered a gimmick, the number of 3 pointers taken per game has steadily increased since the beginning of the 3-point era in 1980. </p>

        <p class="text">
          With the larger role the 3 pointer has in the game, more and more players have refined this craft and are better than ever at shooting it. Some teams have fully bought into the 3 point shot and create their team with the goal of shooting as many 3 pointers as possible. It has gotten to the point where players with the inability to shoot are starting to lose their place in the league.</p>

          Casual fans mock Marcus Smart for his poor shooting and head scratching turnovers, and advanced stat guys struggle to find ways to show his worth. The only thing people agree on is despite his offensive deficiencies, he is a capable defender and plays with hustle. With his contract expiring this season, most fans scoff at the idea of resigning Smart to a lucrative $100 million plus contract that he is projected to receive, pointing towards backup Terry Rozier as a capable replacement. I will present some visualizations comparing Marcus Smart against his own teammates and some of the league's best (and worst) to allow you to form your own opinion this issue. <br>
          We begin by comparing Marcus Smart against some of the league's best perimeter players in this current NBA season (2017-18).

        <p class="text"> 
          Looking at all these traditional metrics, it's not surprising Marcus Smart has his current reputation. Not only is he significantly worse than the league's best, but he is also below league average in every metric. <br>
          Take PER for example, John Hollinger, the creator of PER, has a reference guide of what different PER's mean. Marcus Smart has a PER of 9.8, putting him on the border of a player who shouldn't even be playing in the NBA.

        <p class="text">
          Now we know that Marcus Smart isn't a good shooter, but how does he compare with the worst shooters in the past decades? In the next visualization, we compare Marcus Smart with the 7 worst individual shooting season in NBA history. We introduce the concepts of On-Off Offensive Rating and +/-. Detailed explanations are included in the visualization, but in short... <br> 
          <b>On-Off Offensive Rating</b> shows how a teams offense is affected by a certain player (Smart's On-Off Efficiency of +6.6 indicates the Celtics score 6.6 more points per every 100 possessions when Smart is on the floor). <br>
          <b>+/-</b> shows how a team performs when a certain player is on the floor. (Smart's +9.6 +/- indicates the Celtics outscore their opponents by 9.6 points per 36 minutes of game time).
        </p>
        <canvas data-processing-sources="viz4/viz4.pde viz4/BarGraph.pde viz4/Parser.pde viz4/ScatterPlot.pde viz4/highlight.pde"></canvas>
        <br><br>
        <p class="text">
          As you would expect, when players having historically bad shooting seasons were on the floor, their team suffered. Outside of Marcus Smart, every player had a negative On-Off Offensive Rating and overall +/-. <br>
          Smart is well touted for his defensive instincts and high energy plays.It is reasonable to explain Smart's positive +/- with the impact he has on the game outside of scoring. However, it is harder to explain why the Celtics are an, at best, average offensive team when Smart is not playing, but once he steps on the court, they become an elite top 3 scoring team in the league. Next we compare Smart with the other perimeter players on his own team.
        </p>
        <canvas data-processing-sources="viz5/viz5.pde viz5/BarGraph.pde viz5/CenteredBar.pde viz5/Parser.pde viz5/Stacked.pde viz5/Transitions.pde viz5/TransSameType.pde viz5/TransSameType2.pde"></canvas>
        <p>
          Here we compare Smart with the 4 other perimeter players on the Celtics. I looked at both percentages and makes/attempts to check if this was a case where a player doesn't take many shots, so his low percentages don't negatively impact that game too much. <br>
          Looking at the stats, we see that despite Smart shooting team/league worst percentages, he shoots just as much any other player on the team (outside of Kyrie Irving). In other words, Smart shoots as much as most of his other teammates, but makes far less shots than they do.
          Despite having taking 34 more 3's than teammate and rookie Jayson Tatum, Smart has made 4 less 3's than Tatum has.  Despite shooting less than 30% from behind the arc, Smart takes the 3rd most 3's per game on the Celtics. <br>
          Now looking at the other half of the visualization, we once again look at On-Off Offensive Rating explained earlier. Surprisingly even if the context of his own team, Marcus Smart out performs all of his peers in On-Off Offensive Rating. The teams offense suffers more when Marcus Smart goes off the floor than even their superstar Kyrie Irving. By this metric alone, it looks ridiculous that people look to Terry Rozier as a capable Smart replacement at this point. Despite his shooting, replacing Smart for Rozier on the floor leads an increase in a massive offensive efficiency of about 12. For reference the range in offensive efficiency from the best to worst offenses in the league is 15. <br>
          Below this we look at On-Off Opponent's Offensive Rating. This has the same exact definition, but for the opponents offensive efficiency. Instead of measuring value on offense, it tries to measure a players value on defense (lowering the opponent's offensive rating). A negative On-Off Opponent Offensive Rating means that when the player is on the floor, the opponent scores less points per 100 possessions.  <br>
