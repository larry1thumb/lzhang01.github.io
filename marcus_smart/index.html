        <h1>The Most Confounding Player in the NBA</h1>
        <p>
        Marcus Smart is a point guard in the NBA playing for the Boston Celtics.  He was drafted 6th overall in the 2014 NBA Draft and quickly became one of the most divisive players on the Celtics roster. In a league that is becoming more and more dominated by 3 point shooting and analytics, many question if Smart has a future on this team.</p>
        <p> Though originally considered a gimmick, the number of 3 pointers taken per game has steadily increased since the beginning of the 3-point era in 1980. </p>
        <canvas data-processing-sources="viz1/viz1.pde viz1/LineChart.pde viz1/Parser.pde"></canvas>
        <p>With the larger role the 3 pointer has in the game, more and more players have refined this craft and are better than ever at shooting it. Some teams have fully bought into the 3 point shot and create their team with the goal of shooting as many 3 pointers as possible. It has gotten to the point where players with the inability to shoot are starting to lose their place in the league.</p>
        <canvas data-processing-sources="viz2/viz2.pde viz2/LineChart.pde viz2/Parser.pde"></canvas>
        <p> Casual fans mock Marcus Smart for his poor shooting and head scratching turnovers, and advanced stat guys struggle to find ways to show his worth. Eye-test 'experts' cite his hustle and "game-winning plays" as reason for his worth. With his contract expiring this season, most fans scoff at the idea of resigning Smart to a lucrative $100 million plus contract that he is projected to receive, saying the backup Terry Rozier can easily replace him. I will present some visualizations comparing Marcus Smart against his own teammates and some of the league's best (and worst) and allow you to form your own opinion on if resigning Marcus Smart should be a priority next season.
